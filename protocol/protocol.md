For over a decade [Batumi Raptor Count](https://www.batumiraptorcount.org) has organised systematic monitoring of raptor migration in the Batumi bottleneck. By collecting not only species totals, but also sampling age and sex, we have recently shown our data can be used to detect statistically sound population and demographic trends for several of our target species (Vansteelant et al., 2020).

With excellent conditions to view raptors up close, we are convinced there is great potential to monitor moult of raptors in the Batumi bottleneck as well. Besides breeding and migration, moult is one of the most energy-demanding aspects of a raptor's life and this relatively understudied phenomenon could offer many interesting applications to further our understanding of the ecology of birds of prey. With ever increasing numbers of photographers participating in our monitoring efforts and improving quality of photographic equipment, we can nowadays efficiently study moult through high-quality photographs of migrating raptors.

During the 2021 count season, we will continue the systematic collection of photographs of migrating raptors, for which we have designed the following protocol. The aim of this protocol is to ensure we can collect unbiased photos of large numbers of individuals from our target species, and to do so without burdening photographers with days worth of photo selection and editing. In return for the photos we:
1. Credit photographers for their work in future publications.
2. Offer them access to the entire database of photos collected under this monitoring scheme and the opportunity to take part in or conduct plumage and moult research based on this dataset. 
3. Provide an off-site backup of all originals (even RAW photos) collected and stored in the database. 

In the spirit of ‘open science’ we have recently made our count dataset [available through GBIF](https://www.batumiraptorcount.org/news/2019/4/brc-goes-open-access) and in the future we intend to make our photo database, including developed software, available for research purposes as well.

## Photography Protocol

### In the field
First and foremost: collecting photos of migrating raptors should **never** happen instead of counting, identifying and/or ageing of birds and should **always** be done by a person not involved in any of these tasks at that moment.

1. The same species we target for the count should be prioritised by photographers, so Honey Buzzards, Black Kites, Lesser Spotted Eagles, Booted Eagles, Short-toed Eagles, Marsh, Montagu's and Pallid Harriers. Collecting photos of other species is welcomed, but should not be prioritised.
2. Photographers should prioritise birds flying close in distance codes W1, O and E, so we automatically get a random sample of the birds and we can collect high-quality (= useful) photos on which we can see moult and plumage features.
3. Photographers should try to photograph as many different individuals as possible and to expose photos so plumage features are clearly visible. Furthermore, it is best to photograph multiple individuals from streams of birds rather than solo individuals, to reduce the bias towards photographing *just* interesting looking individuals. In principle only 1 photographer takes photos from one stream at a time.
4. All cameras should have their time synced with the tablets set to the Georgian timezone, so we can link the photos to our count records, which also have a timestamp attached.
5. Photographers preferably set their cameras to shoot in RAW (or RAW + JPEG).

### In the evenings
A schedule will be made so that every few days someone from BRC or an appointed researcher collects photos from photographers. As we don't want to waste precious time off in the evenings and do not want to introduce additional bias, all photos will be copied to a large external hard disk, without making any selections beforehand (with the possible exclusion of personal photos of people, etcetera). The files will be organized as follows:
```
BRC 2021/[Photographer Name]/[Date]/[Date]T[Time]-[Photographer Name]-[Photo Number].[Extension]
``` 
So for example the file `20210827T1115-Bart_Hoekstra-378.CR2` is stored in `BRC 2019/Bart Hoekstra/20190827/`. Processing these photos for research purposes happens after the season has finished.
